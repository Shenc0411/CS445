1. Core Assignment(100 or 105?):

45 points for implementation to create hybrid images from two aligned input images.
- 45 points. 

25 points for illustration and additional results: 15 points for FFT images; 10 points for including at least two examples beyond the first (including at least one failure).
- 25 points. I have written lots of comments to explain my codes. I have also put one example for successful hybrid and two examples for failures on my webpage.

10 points for quality of results (e.g., 0=poor 5=average 10=great 15=amazing)
- 10 or 15 points. I think the eyes of the panda image and the owl image match perfectly and the result in the pyramids are satisfactory.

20 points for two image enhancement tasks (10 pts each), including explanation and display of results.
- 20 points. There are also comments in the image enhancement codes to explain the methods I used.

2. Bells & Whistles
- 25 points.
    1. I did the gaussian and lapacian pyramids.
    2. I did the third image enhancement task.
